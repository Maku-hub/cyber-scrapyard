# Recommended Cybersecurity Certification Path

Below is my **recommended certification path**, based on what I’ve found to be the most effective learning progression for building strong, real-world cybersecurity skills.  
This is **not the only path**, but in my opinion it’s one of the clearest and most practical sequences for most beginners and intermediate learners.

There are **many other valuable certifications** depending on your specialization — offensive security, blue team, cloud security, governance, forensics, or management. Cybersecurity is a huge field, and every professional eventually chooses a direction that fits their goals.
