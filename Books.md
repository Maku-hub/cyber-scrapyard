# Recommended Cybersecurity Book List

Below is a collection of books that **I personally like and recommend** for anyone beginning or growing their cybersecurity skills.  
This list isn’t the only possible path, but in my opinion it provides a strong and practical foundation across networking, Linux, programming, and ethical hacking.

## Networking

* **Adam Józefiok** — ***CCNA 200-120. Zostań administratorem sieci komputerowych Cisco***  
Great introduction to networking fundamentals, routing, switching, and Cisco concepts with clear explanations in Polish.

* **Mike Meyers, Scott Jernigan** — ***CompTIA Network+ All-in-One Exam Guide***  
Beginner-friendly, broad coverage of networking essentials. Excellent for learning before diving into cybersecurity topics.

## Linux

* **Christopher Negus** — ***Linux Bible***

* **Karol Szafrański** — ***Twierdza Linux: Bezpieczeństwo dla dociekliwych***  
*A practical, security-focused Linux book. Great for understanding hardening, permissions, and real-world defensive practices.*

## Programming & Exploitation Basics
* **Justin Seitz, Tim Arnold** — ***Black Hat Python***  
*Shows how Python is used in offensive security: writing tools, exploits, backdoors. Highly practical.*

* **Jon Erickson** — ***Hacking: The Art of Exploitation***  
*A classic. Teaches low-level concepts (memory, assembly, exploitation) with hands-on examples. More advanced, but extremely rewarding.*

## Cybersecurity
